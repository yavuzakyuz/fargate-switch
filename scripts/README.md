# ECS Image Updater Script: updateImage.sh

A Bash script to update the Docker image for an AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) service in a specific cluster. This script helps streamline the process of switching to a new Docker image for your ECS service.

## Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured with the necessary permissions.
- An AWS ECS cluster and service that you wish to update.
- A Docker image you want to switch to, hosted in a container registry.

## Usage

1. Provide the script with execute permissions: 
   ```bash
   chmod +x updateImage.sh
   ./updateImage.sh

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to provide:
   - AWS Region
   - ECS Cluster Name
   - ECS Service Name
   - Full Image Name (e.g., public.ecr.aws/docker/library/httpd:latest)

After the script runs, it will update the ECS service to use the provided Docker image.
